It was windy though (10-20mph, 30mph gusts) which kept my wife and I cool but blasted us when we got to the dunes.  The hike itself is really nice because it's away from everything and not very many people hike it.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and saw only one car but saw no one on the trail. "

    "description": "Your trip begins along the Middle Fork Road. The hike is wildly popular--on a typical weekend, the trailhead can have upward of 50 cars at any given hour. The new trail also came with a new upper parking lot, but even so, don't expect to get a spot in the parking lot unless you arrive very early. Hang your Discover Pass in your car and head out, walking for a short jaunt along a paved DNR road. Approach a gate and slip around it. About one hundred yards past the gate, an inviting opening indicates the location of the new trail. Set out for the summit here, along a trail that switchbacks along the northwest face of Mailbox Peak.",
